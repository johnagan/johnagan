Hey, I’m John — I’ve helped build and grow platforms like GitHub, Slack, Twitch, Webflow, and Replit. I like making tools that devs love, turning messy data into useful stuff, and scaling big ideas without the bloat. This is my corner for experiments, half-finished projects, and the occasional good idea.
